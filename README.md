# TIW-MusicPlaylist
*Web Technologies course project at Politecnico of Milan Developed in collaboration with: @FeBD8*

---
This project consists of a web application that allows management of a music playlist. 
The web application is realised in 2 ways :
*  _Pure Hmtl_ : With java servlets and thymeleaf for the presentation. 
*  _RIA_ : With java servlet and javascript.
In both cases **JDBC** is then used as interface to connect with the database.
Here there are some images taken from the web application.

### Playlist management
Here each user can visualize his playlists and reorder them.
